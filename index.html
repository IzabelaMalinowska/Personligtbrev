              The dynamic development and diversity of the IT industry contribute to the increase in job offers in this field. There are few sectors, such as working in IT, that guarantee such great development opportunities, while offering high salaries. The IT sector has its own specificity that distinguishes it from other sectors on the labor market. Employees almost never have reasons to complain about the lack of work or unsatisfactory employment conditions. The development of technology drives the search for IT specialists, and completing the Front End Developer course gives me the opportunity to acquire new skills and qualifications in a relatively short time.
In addition, the specificity of the IT sector is closely related to constant changes. It is not only creating websites or applications, but also designing and comprehensive implementation of business solutions. Especially in the profession of a programmer, it requires constant mastering of new skills, as well as adaptation to changing conditions and requirements. This gives me great development opportunities, lack of routine and interesting projects.
This is why I would like to start this course.</div></p>
            <p class="text" id="why-me"><h3 class="subtitle">Why me?</h3>
              <div class="text-background">
              Working as a developer is perfect for me because I am focused on gaining and expanding knowledge, because it motivates me to act. The IT industry focuses on development above all, which is in line with my priorities.
I can work independently as well as in a team. I also have experience as a Team Leader and Manager, which may be an asset for my employer in the future. I appreciate the opportunity to learn from other team members as well as the availability of training and courses offered by employers.
Working in IT gives me the opportunity to work both at home and in the office, which suits me very well because I am disciplined, conscientious, responsible and able to organize my working day well. I am also fully available and it is not a problem for me to work at different hours if necessary.
Working in IT often requires contact with the client, which is my strength. I have over 15 years of experience in work closely related to the sale of services.
I believe that my personal qualities and professional experience will allow me to prove myself as a developer.</div></p>
            <p class="text" id="about-me"><h3 class="subtitle">About me</h3>
              <div class="text-background">
              I am an energetic and optimistic person with over 15 years of experience as a trader and 10 years of experience as a team leader in the insurance industry. I graduated from the university with a degree in enonomy in Poland. I moved to Sweden 6 years ago because it is a country that offers many opportunities for development. My success in recent years has been to open a hair salon with my sambo and increase profits by 30%.
I like to set high goals and requirements for myself. One of them is changing the industry and getting your dream job in the IT industry. In the future, I want to work as an IT Project Manager in the financial industry. I know that I am perfectly prepared for this, and the Front End Developer course will allow me to gain the necessary knowledge in the field of IT.

I am proficient in computer and office equipment and I am interested
issues in the field of Lean Manufacturing and Lean Management.
My hobby is hairdressing and interior decorating.

My strengths include the ability to work both independently and in a team, communicativeness, creativity, conscientiousness, diligence, loyalty, creative and flexible approach to new situations, resistance to stress, easy adaptation to changes, and above all, focus on success.</div></p>
